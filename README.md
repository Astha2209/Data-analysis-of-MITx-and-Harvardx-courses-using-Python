# Data-analysis-of-MITx-and-Harvardx-courses-using-Python

This repository deals with data exploration and analysis of MITx and HarvardX courses on the edx platform during academic year 2013 (Fall 2012, Spring 2013 and Summer 2013) using Python. For this project, I have used HarvardX and MITx Person Course Dataset. This dataset is at the level of one row per-person per-course.
